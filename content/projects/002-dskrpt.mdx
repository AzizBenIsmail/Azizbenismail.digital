When I joined dskrpt, we were right in the midst of migrating to a React-based ProseMirror integration for the text editor.

The challenge was to set up a reliable and scalable frontend architecture. And to design a lot of complex interactions around the editor. I was sold ðŸ˜„

Within the first months, we did the groundwork of adding type-support throughout the app, integrating a RTK-Query based data layer with optimistic updates and error handling, and implementing real-time collaboration via Websockets.

After that, we improved the editing experience bit by bit. This involved understanding who we were actually building for and what their needs were.

Interactive features, such as adding annotations or messaging on threads, only flourish if they feel intuitive for users from the very beginning. Designing and implementing all of these interactions was definitely one of my highlights.
