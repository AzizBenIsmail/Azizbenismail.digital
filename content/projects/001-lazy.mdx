  summary: "What sets Konstantin apart is his ability to approach problems from multiple angles and, importantly, his knack for selecting the most effective solution.\n\nBut it's not just his tech skills that shine, Konstantin's always got a smile on his face, and he's the ultimate team player. He's the kind of colleague who makes the office a better place. I can't recommend Konstantin enough, he's not just a top-notch developer, he's the kind of person you want on your team."

When I joined Lazy, we were right in the midst of migrating to a new text editing framework. Since the old editor wasn‚Äôt as performant and extensible as we had hoped, we decided to switch to [tiptap.dev](https://tiptap.dev), a relatively new library back then.

After we introduced our own block-based content schema, we started implementing numerous extensions. Ranging from simple text formatting to more complex features like drag-and-drop and mentions.

### Annotations in Lazy

A key flow in Lazy is the ability to make highlights and annotations. You can do this either on the content source itself (e.g. a Twitter thread opened in your browser) or right inside Lazy. In both scenarios, your captured highlights should be grouped under a ‚ÄúHighlights‚Äù block that is connected to the original content. Let's have a look at how this works üîª

/>

The connected original content, which we call ‚ÄùClip‚Äù, safely stores all of the highlights and is automatically synced with the Highlights block. So, you can freely add, modify, and delete highlights, and we make sure that both blocks stay in sync.

Implementing this flow was challenging, but it also allowed us to push the boundaries of what we thought was possible. It allowed me to dive deep into how transaction handling works inside ProseMirror, and how we can make sure that such complex and interactive features remain stable over time.
