When Giacomo reached out to have feedback on his idea, I was hooked. User retention is a ubiquitous problem in the software-as-a-service space.

To validate the core premise of vykee, we built a little prototype that focused just on that: Hide complex features until they become relevant.

I particularly enjoyed working interchangeably on product and development. Not simply building whatever the spec tells me to build, but continuously sparring ideas and evolving the product hand in hand.

Thus, we could quickly iterate on important strategic and architectural decisions. And eventually build a small yet lovable first version of vykee!

Overall, vykee is a perfect example of product validation done right. Flesing out a simple prototype, demoing to early adopters, and continuously evaluating assumptions.

I look forward to seeing vykee evolve and grow!
