Throughout the past few years, I published several open-source projects. Some became an overnight success, and some didn’t even get a single star on GitHub. But I was happy nonetheless. I always did it for fun, interest, and the urge to give back.

I only recently realized how all that influenced my trajectory as a freelancer. It changed the skills recruiters associate with my profile. It changed the projects and roles I got hired for.

This got me thinking. I have always struggled with marketing as a freelancer. I never had a reliable way of finding interesting projects to work on. It always seemed as if a vast following on Twitter was the only solution.

But looking back on my last projects, I’d say that open-source projects can be as effective in terms of marketing as Twitter — perhaps even better.

In this article, I’d like to share my thoughts and…

1. Show why more freelancers should bet on open-source projects instead of Twitter followers.
2. Nurture ideas on how you can actually create successful open-source projects without starting a second full-time job as an open-source maintainer.

## Grow open-source projects, instead of Twitter audiences

As a freelancer, you usually work together with clients on certain projects. This collaboration embeds two essential questions: 1) how do those clients get in touch with you, and 2) what are those projects all about?

Answering both questions will involve some marketing, even though most developers (myself included) hate it. But if you are not relying entirely on recommendations, you need a channel to reach your target audience. This is how you get in touch with clients.

The project contents involve marketing, too, as they usually stem from a service definition that you once (passively or actively) defined and communicated (e.g. “I do frontend development with React.js”).

There are numerous ways to answer these two questions:

1. You could build a portfolio site (i.e. communicating your services) and run YouTube ads (i.e. reaching clients) to channel prospects to your site.
2. You could engage on Twitter (i.e. reaching clients) and discuss stuff you are interested in (i.e. communicating your services).

The list goes on…

However, I found open-source projects to be a fantastic way of marketing your services as a freelance developer. It actually creates a win-win situation for everybody involved.

Some benefits are obvious (and pretty easily achievable with other approaches as well), but some are clearly unique to open-source development.

Let’s start with the obvious yet still important reasons to bet on open-source for your marketing.

### Being an expert in topics that interest you.

All my published open-source projects orbit around topics I am interested in.

When I built my notion-clone project, it was because I wanted to develop my first backend API and understand how apps like Notion work. When I built my Gatsby theme, I wanted to see how theme development in Gatsby works (and how it compares to Wordpress themes).

I initially published them because I wanted to share my insights and give something back to the community.

Years later, I realized how heavily these projects influenced my freelance work. I got more requests for Notion-like apps. I got hired to build Gatsby sites. People who found my open-source projects and wanted something similar reached out to me.

Without continuously pushing my projects, I became an expert (even though I dislike the term) in those topics.

This got me thinking how great open-source projects actually are. They can create a win-win situation for everybody involved:

- You learn something while building them.
- You give something back to the community.
- You learn from the community (when they start contributing to your projects).
- You get free marketing from the community (when they start using and sharing your projects).
- You find new prospects in topics you are interested in.

Listing your open-source projects can almost replace your developer portfolio. The listed projects clearly communicate topics you are passionate about. Hence, recruiters who look for this very skillset will reach out to you.

As other developers start using and sharing your projects, you get exposure and an audience without much marketing on your behalf – other than providing great pieces of software for free.

### Build trust with new clients right away.

When recruiters evaluate your profile, they want to primarily know whether or not you can solve their problem.

So the question becomes: how can you effectively communicate and prove you have what it needs?

Typically, freelancers showcase projects they recently worked on on their portfolio sites. This is a great approach since if you worked on similar projects, it is likely that you can apply the same skills to the project at hand.

Publishing open-source projects goes a step beyond that.

Not only can recruiters see what skills you have, they also get insights into your approach to programming and managing projects. Do you write concise code that is documented and well-tested? How do you deal with issues and stakeholder requests?

As an open-source maintainer, you expose your entire programming and collaboration workflow to the public. That is awesome as it is a perfect evaluation criteria for recruiters.

They know exactly what they get – even before they started working with you. This will build trust with clients right away.

To me, this is another benefit of open-source development that Twitter cannot offer. While having a huge audience certainly makes finding clients easier, it cannot build as much trust right from the beginning.

### Develop a composability mindset.

Contributing to open-source is something I genuinely enjoy. It makes me happy, each time my projects help someone save hours of research and development.

Because of that, I try to release as much as possible to the public - so that as many people as possible can benefit from it.

This led to an interesting shift in my development process. I started to ask myself more often: “Is this functionality something that could be abstracted into an open-source package?”

By asking this regularly, I tend to create more reusable features and components than before.

This is especially beneficial for freelancers. You usually work on similar projects over and over again. By abstracting common functionalities into packages, you don’t have to reimplement the same features again each time.

I actually did this with my Gatsby theme. Instead of building a new site from scratch, I installed my theme package and modified existing functionality to meet the client’s requirements. This saved me a lot of hours.

Nonetheless, the composability mindset should be treated carefully. We all know how much developers love to build over-engineered solutions to simple problems. Hence, only abstract a functionality if it really makes sense and if there is a benefit for the community and yourself in terms of reusability.

## How to effectively build open-source projects

Now, let’s talk about how you can actually build and maintain open-source projects without the risk of burning out. This is indeed a problem since maintaining projects can become incredibly time-consuming as the project grows.

So how can we build and maintain projects on the side, without letting them become a second full-time job?

Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet for this as it ultimately depends on what projects you want to build and how much time you want to invest.

However, I still want to give some practical tips that helped me a lot:

### Release what you already have built

When thinking about creating open-source projects, you don’t necessarily have to build something new from the ground up. Is there anything you built in the past that could be published right away?

This is how almost all of my open-source projects came to live. My Gatsby theme was essentially just my own personal portfolio turned into a theme. My notion-clone app was a learning project I wanted to do anyway. In both instances, I just decided to share it with the public so that other developers can either reuse it or learn from it.

When it comes to open-source projects, we often think about popular libraries like _testing-library_ or _react-query_. But it does not have to be that sophisticated.

What about publishing a documented version of your portfolio? This requires almost no additional work. And [Brittany’s site](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4) became incredibly popular by just that (over 6,000 Github stars)!

Whatever you are building right now, I am sure that there is someone else who might be interested in learning from that. So, take a minute to think about your recent projects and what you could turn into an open-source project.

Note: Just be careful about company- or client-related contents. Never publish anything you build for a client without asking for permission.

### Document and automate as much as possible

While building and releasing a project is the fun part (most times), continuously maintaining it can become a time-consuming monster. Packages get outdated incredibly fast, and with outdated packages issues arise alike.

Since your primary job is to work on client projects, this can become a real problem. So how can we minimize the footprint that our open-source projects have on our schedule?

There is actually [an amazing talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCJyiBu12Jw) held by Kent C Dodds on exactly this issue. There are two main ideas: document and automate. As much as possible.

Think about common questions someone who uses the packages run into. Putting a lot of effort into answering those upfront will save you a lot of time in the long term.

The same goes for automation and enabling community contributors to improve the project. If you have transparent and reliable workflows for releasing new versions and incorporating contributions, your project maintenance will (almost) feel effortless.

I try to regularly set time apart to update and improve my projects so that they stay relevant and valuable for the community. And get help from the community in doing so too!

Now that was a long post for simply stating: build and publish your own open-source projects as a freelancer. But I really do mean it.

I can’t think of any other professional field that has such an active community full of people who genuinely want to help each other. So let’s keep this alive by sharing more of what we built and learned with the community!

I am looking forward to seeing your open-source projects! Feel free to share them with me on Twitter. <TwitterHandle />
