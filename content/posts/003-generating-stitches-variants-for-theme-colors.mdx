I recently came across [Stitches.dev](http://Stitches.dev) when I rebuilt my portfolio. Using a CSS-in-JS library with almost zero interpolations at runtime and a very well designed API seemed appealing - so I tried it!

#### What are Variants in Stitches?

A feature Stitches offers are variants. This is one of its key differences compared to [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), which was one of the first and still most popular CSS-in-JS tools. Whereas Styled Components used string interpolation to conditionally set styles, Stitches lets you predefine variants to avoid unnecessary interpolation. This significantly enhances performance.

A simple example can be found in this [Stitches docs](https://stitches.dev/docs/variants):

```tsx:Button.tsx
const Button = styled('button', {
  // base styles

  variants: {
    color: {
      violet: { backgroundColor: 'blueviolet' },
      gray: { backgroundColor: 'gainsboro' },
    },
  },
});

() => <Button color="violet">Button</Button>;
```

### Using Your Theme's Color Palette To Create Variants

When I built my portfolio, I wanted to have such a variant-based button component too. But I wanted it to be highly customizable - instead of having two defined color variants, it should accept any color that I defined in my themeâ€™s color palette.

#### The Manual Way

The easiest (and probably fastest ðŸ˜„) way would have been to manually create a variant for each color I used in my theme. So something like this:

```tsx:Button.tsx
const Button = styled('button', {
  // base styles

  variants: {
    color: {
      background: { backgroundColor: '$background' },
      surface50: { backgroundColor: '$surface50' },
      surface100: { backgroundColor: '$surface100' },
      surface250: { backgroundColor: '$surface250' },
      surface500: { backgroundColor: '$surface500' },
      secondary50: { backgroundColor: '$secondary50' },
      secondary100: { backgroundColor: '$secondary100' },
      secondary250: { backgroundColor: '$secondary250' },
      secondary500: { backgroundColor: '$secondary500' },
	  ...
    },
  },
});

() => <Button color="violet">Button</Button>;
```

This would have been perfectly fine but I was eager to automate this process so that I could reuse the same functionality in other components too.

#### The Automated Way

Since Stitches uses an object syntax to write CSS, we can write a function that generates an object that contains all the CSS for the needed variants.

In the end, we end up with this little piece of Stitches CSS:

```tsx:Button.tsx
const Button = styled('button', {
  // base styles

  variants: {
    color: generateColorPaletteVariants({ backgroundColor: '$â€“â€“colorâ€“â€“' }),
  },
});

() => <Button color="violet">Button</Button>;
```

Letâ€™s look into `generateColorPaletteVariants` to see what it does internally. Admittedly, it is a bit hackyâ€¦ but hey, it works!

```tsx:generateColorPaletteVariants.ts
import * as Stitches from '@stitches/react';

import { theme } from '@config/stitches.config';

const COLOR_PATTERN = '$â€“â€“colorâ€“â€“';
const REGEX = /\"([^\"]*?\$â€“â€“colorâ€“â€“[^\"]*?)\"/;

export const generateColorPaletteVariants = (css: Stitches.CSS) => {
  const cssString = JSON.stringify(css);

  return Object.values(theme.colors).reduce((prev, color) => {
    const substringToReplace = REGEX.exec(cssString);
    if (!substringToReplace?.length) throw Error('No Color Token provided.');

    const replacedSubstring = substringToReplace[0].replace(
      COLOR_PATTERN,
      `$${color.token}`
    );

    const replacedString = cssString.replace(
      substringToReplace[0],
      replacedSubstring
    );

    return { ...prev, [color.token]: JSON.parse(replacedString) };
  }, {}) as Record<keyof typeof theme.colors, Stitches.CSS>;
};
```

In essence, we just stringify our Stitches CSS object, do some magic replacing via regex, and return the parsed string that contains the modified styles.

The `css` parameter of the function represents the styles of each variant item. In the previous example, we used `{ backgroundColor: '$â€“â€“colorâ€“â€“' }` but it could be more complex too, of course.

By using a specific color pattern (`$â€“â€“colorâ€“â€“`), we can automatically insert theme colors in the styling of the variant. So, when looping through the theme colors object, `{ backgroundColor: '$â€“â€“colorâ€“â€“' }` becomes `{ backgroundColor: '$surface50' }` in the first iteration.

Thus, we have a button that accepts each theme color for the color prop - without manually adding all necessary variants.

I hope this helps you in speeding up your development process using Stitches. If you have a better approach for doing this, let me know!

Also, I highly recommend checking out the library if you look for a fresh and performant way of writing your CSS-in-JS styles.
